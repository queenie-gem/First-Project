<h2 align = "center"> HIS POLITICAL EXPERIENCE </h2>

<h3 align = "center"> Exposure to Political Ideologies </h3><br/>

<p align = "justified">
Fela Kuti's political awakening began during his visit to the United States in the late 1960s. There, he encountered the Black Power movement and civil rights activism, which profoundly influenced his worldview. He met Sandra Smith, a Black Panther activist, who introduced him to Pan-Africanist ideologies and the writings of Malcolm X. This exposure motivated Fela to use his music as a tool for political and social change.

Returning to Nigeria, Fela transformed his music into a platform for political commentary. He addressed themes such as corruption, police brutality, inequality, and the failures of the Nigerian government. Songs like "Zombie" mocked the Nigerian military’s blind obedience, while "Sorrow, Tears, and Blood" highlighted the repression faced by ordinary citizens. His music became anthems of resistance, resonating with marginalized communities.

Fela established the Kalakuta Republic, a self-declared independent state, to symbolize his rejection of Nigeria’s corrupt leadership. The commune housed his band, family, and political allies, and it became a hub for activism. Kalakuta often faced attacks from the government, with the most notable being a 1977 military raid that destroyed the commune and led to the death of Fela's mother.
