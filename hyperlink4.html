<h2 align = "center"> HIS FAMILY LIFE </h2>

<h3 align = "center"> Early Family Dynamics </h3><br/>

<p align = "justified">
Fela Kuti was born into a well-established and highly influential family. His father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was a teacher and a prominent figure in the Anglican Church. He was a strict disciplinarian who believed in the importance of education. Fela’s mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a courageous and determined activist, renowned for her role in the Nigerian women’s rights movement. Growing up in such a progressive and intellectual household played a key role in shaping Fela's worldview.

Fela’s mother, Funmilayo, was perhaps the most significant influence on his early life. She was the first woman in Nigeria to drive a car and the founder of the Nigerian Women’s Union, which campaigned for women’s rights, including the fight for equal pay and the end of the British colonial tax system. Funmilayo's activism and fierce independence had a profound impact on Fela, inspiring him to challenge societal norms and fight against injustice throughout his career.

<p align = "justified">
Fela’s relationship with his father, Reverend Israel Ransome-Kuti, was more complex. His father had strong religious and educational values, expecting Fela to follow in his footsteps by becoming a doctor or a lawyer. However, Fela’s passion for music often clashed with his father's wishes. Despite this tension, Fela admired his father’s intellectual approach to life, and the values of discipline and self-reliance were instilled in him early on, even as he pursued his own path in music.

Later in life, Fela had several wives and children, creating a large and complex family. He was known for his polygamous lifestyle, famously having up to 27 wives at one time. His children, including Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, both musicians, have continued his Afrobeat legacy. Fela’s family remained deeply involved in his music and activism, with many members actively participating in promoting his revolutionary ideas, both in Nigeria and internationally. The Kuti family's commitment to social justice and artistic excellence remains central to Fela's enduring legacy.
